# AR
Just to quickly get this project underway, I have used quite a bit of shortcuts such as, code duplication or lazy programming styles which I normally don't do and it could be easily cleaned up if need be.

I would be glad to answer any questions you may have or ask how else I would have approached this project if scalability was pertinant.

EasyAR did not successfully work on build, but it does work in the editor. I have tried many different solutions, it may be related to some of my settings. I should be able to solve this quickly, but I would prefer the project be available to you in the meantime.
