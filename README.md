Just to quickly get this project underway, I have used quite a bit of shortcuts such as, code duplication or lazy programming styles which I normally don't do and it could be easily cleaned up if need be.

I would be glad to answer any questions you may have or ask how else I would have approached this project if scalability was pertinant.
